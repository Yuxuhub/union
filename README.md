The Union Army Has Been Putting in the Work — Let’s Celebrate with Some Whale Sharks! 🐋🦈

There’s no denying it — the grind has been real. The Union Army has shown nothing but commitment, and it’s only right that we recognize that hustle. But not just with applause — with NFTs. Big ones. The kind that only whale sharks deserve.

Here’s what’s going down:

We’re rolling out a special giveaway, and the higher your level on the Union Dashboard, the better your chances of walking away with something special. The NFT drop is designed to reward active members across different ranks — but especially those who’ve been consistently leveling up.

Here’s the breakdown of how many NFTs are up for grabs at each rank (based on the latest level distribution):

Level 3 – Junior Sergeant: 1 NFT

Level 4 – Sergeant: 1 NFT

Level 5 – Senior Sergeant: 1 NFT

Level 6 – Starshina: 2 NFTs (because this level has the highest number of participants so far!)

Level 7 – Junior Lieutenant: 1 NFT

Level 8 – Lieutenant: 1 NFT

Level 9 – Senior Lieutenant: 1 NFT

Level 10 – Junior Captain: 1 NFT
